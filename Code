#Imagine a new organization that advocates for governmental R&D funding 
#to prevent or reduce the impact of future pandemics. 

#(A) What factors would affect the organization's cost-effectiveness? 

#(B) Do your best to combine the factors you selected in a back-of-the-envelope 
#calculation that models the organization's cost-effectiveness. 

#(C) Assign values to all of your factors (based on your best guess) 
#so that the end result is a single number that describes the cost-effectiveness 
#of this charity.*

#I am assuming that this organization aims to petition for governments to allocate 
#innovation funding like UKRI and Horizon Europe funding to pandemic preparedness. 

#This means that a small amount of organizational funding has a chance to divert 
#a large amount of additional public funding to pandemic preparedness. 

#I will assume the organization is awarded a seed grant of £100k, which is the midrange
#of the funding Charity Entrepreneurship allocates (range is 77-125k).

#The goal here is to compare this intervention with other well-established interventions,
#i.e. malaria bed nets and trachoma surgeries. 

#My assumption is that petitioning for this funding has a 20% change of meaningfully 
#allocating more resources to pandemic preparedness, which in turn has a 20% chance 
#of meaningfully reducing the impact of a further pandemic by 5%. 
#This seems reasonable, as funding-limited resource allocation (e.g. ventilators, PPE etc) are tractable, 
#and contributed to covid survivability rates.

amf.cost.per.life/intervention.cost.per.life

#This has the potential to be 480 times more cost-effective than the Against Malaria Foundation's cost-per-life saved
#via malarial bed-nets. 

#Another benefit could be found through long-covid cases. Chronic sickness resulting from pandemics can affect 
#breadwinners in developing countries. The CDC estimates that 19% of people with covid-19 develop long-covid. 
#So 145 million people have been affected by the last pandemic.

#I'm attempting to compare this to another chronic disease that affects people's economic output, e.g. blindness.

#cause area where is ample scope for more  funding.

#The EV of preventing a chronic disease is 6p, or 440 times higher ev than trachoma surgery. 

#You have asked for a single number that combines the cost effectiveness of this charity. 
#I'll estimate that preventing chronic illness is 1/10th as valuable as preventing a death.
